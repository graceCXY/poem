A sea of red gowns 
I close my eyes
Colors, bursting 

smiling at friends 
Pink Cotton Candy 

Making dumb mistakes
Orange Sour Keys 

making presentations 
Dark chocolate 

five years of high school 
my favourite rainbow Bacon 
Throwing Graduation caps into the air 
Sweet with a hint of melancholy
